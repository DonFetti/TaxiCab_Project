    "The dataset used for this project contains data gathered by the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission. For each trip, there are many different data variables gathered as seen in the dictionary below. The main goal of this project is to build a model that can predict the \"total_amount\" or final cost of a trip before the trip is taken so that this price may be shown to prospective riders to increase sales since buyers are more likely to buy a service when they know what they are getting. Also it's important to note that for the purposes of this project we are making the assumption that riders enter in the relevant information (Mainly Pickup/Dropoff Location from which many other variables can be derived) prior to booking the ride, the same way you would if you were using UBER for example."

    "#### _Let's start_ by taking an overview of the features and their importance to the main goal and see if there is any columns that can be premtively dropped so as to not waste time exploring them. (This would obviously be impractical on a dataset with a lot of features however I am including this here due to this being a portfolio project and therefore my thought process may be important to see)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trip ID**: This is a statically increasing integer count of trips that I do not believe to even be specific to each vehicle (i.e. each vehicle tracks their own ride numbers) so this feature cannot be used in any way to predict the final cost of the ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vendor ID**: There are two vendors in this dataset and they may have different rates they charge with thier taxis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pickup Datetime**: These values can be used to analyze if certain times in the day have more or less demand and thus may incur a premuim due the laws of supply/demand. If certain times can be proven to be more expensive then we can use this to predict final cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dropoff Datetime**: These values would not be avialable when our model is deployed, and although we could make the assumption that we could estimate this time, for the purposes of this project that assumption will not be made.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Passenger Count**: Since we don't know the ins and outs the policies at these taxi companies, drivers may be permitted to charge a premium based on certain amounts of riders, so this feature will need investigation as it may be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trip Distance**: We would expect this to be the one of the features with the highest correlation with the final cost of the ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pickup/Dropoff Location**: These values can be used to analyze if certain zones have more or less traffic and thus take the taxi driver longer to navigate them making the ride run longer which would increase the final cost of the ride.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ratecode**: This variable will need investgation as to how much of an effect it has on the final cost\n",
    "\n",
    "**Store & Forward Flag**: This variable is not expected to be valueable in predicting the final cost since it only tracks information that is gathed after the ride has taken place.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Payment Type**: We will need to checkk whether it makes a difference whether a rider pays by cash or card.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fare Amount**: Since this feature is made up of other features which will be included in the final model, it is not necessary to include, since it will add undue additional weight to those features comprising it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extra**: This is a varible taken down at rides end and not available beforehand but since it only tracks certain premiums based on the time of day we can make binary columns in the dataset to track it instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "**MTA Tax**: A nearly perfectly static 50 cent charge applied after the ride ends, its value is included in the final cost already so this column is not necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvement Surcharge**: A static 30 cent charge on every ride, provides no predictive power since it never changes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip Amount**: Since tips are a variable controlled by the rider it can't reliably be predicted in a general sense, and probably not even in a per rider sense, even if we knew who was taking the ride and could remember thier previous tips. We will need to create a new column in the data set that tracks the subtotal of the ride (total_amount without tips) and then try to predict that\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tolls Amount**: This is another variable we would not have prior to the ride being completed, and since we do not have the data or capabilities within this setting to gather data and route information to estimate what tolls may be paid during the course of the trip, we will have to accept this value being added to the total and remove what variance we can by with the pickup and dropoff locations, since they may correlate with the tolls.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Amount**: As mentioned above we will be creating a new final cost column called subtotal, which is this value with tips subtracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **In conclusion**, the features we will remove will be ID, Store_and_fwd_flag, Extra, MTA_tax, Improvement_surcharge, Tip_amount, Tolls_amount, Total_amount. But for now we will need to keep all the features the effect the subtotal, since if there are any outliers within them we will not know. And we will keep fare_amount and total_amount should we want them for visualization purposes. So let's load in the data and drop these columns, but first we need to import some modules."
